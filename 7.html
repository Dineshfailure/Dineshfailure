            <p>Cricketing contests between the two nations have usually been of high intensity. The importance of the series is also fuelled by Australia's desire to beat India in a Test match series in India, which, until their victory in the 2004–05 series, they had not done so since 1969–70. India has developed a reputation of being particularly difficult to beat at home, having lost only two Test series since 1986–87. Conversely, India had never managed to win a Test series in Australia until 2018–19 series, after which they continued their winning streak in the 2020-21 series, thereby retaining the trophy for two editions outside home. The competitiveness of the series played between the two sides is also reflected in the fact that in both 2000–01 and 2007–08, it was India who ended Australia's runs of 16 consecutive Test wins. Matches in India are commonly described with labels like final frontier or iconic event. The Test series held in India in 2000–01 was labelled the final frontier by Steve Waugh and it lived up to its reputation; it had the closest result in decades with India overpowering the mighty Australians in the final session of the final Test at Chennai. The series also gave the cricketing world three champion cricketers in Hayden, Harbhajan and Laxman[5] who were relatively unknown or under-performing till then. They were the cornerstones of the series and the duels between Laxman & Australian bowlers on the one hand; and Harbhajan & Hayden on the other are often termed the most engrossing player rivalries in a Test series of cricket. The series was played in the backdrop of the death of legendary Sir Donald Bradman who was quoted as saying that he was very much looking forward to the series and had high expectations of both the teams.
</p>
             <p>The four-match series which was scheduled for October – November 2022 was moved because of T20 World Cup held in Australia in October 2022. The series will now be played in February 2023.[52]

              The first Test started on 9 February 2023 at Nagpur. Australian skipper Pat Cummins won the toss and elected to bat first. Aussies in their first innings bowled out for 177. Recovering Indian spinner dominated this innings by taking a fiver. The Indians on the other hand scored a massive 400 runs taking a lead of 223 runs. Australia's second innings was totally a failure bowling out only on 91. Following an inning and 132 runs win in the first Test, the Man of the match was given to Ravindra Jadeja for his great comeback.</p>
             <p>The second started on 13 February 2023 in Delhi. Pat Cummins won the toss and elected to bat first. In the first inning, Australia scored an impressive 263. In reply,  India scored 262 trailing by just 1 run. Aussies leading by a thin margin had an advantage leading to the second innings, however, they were bundled out for just 113. Ravindra Jadeja took a career-best 7/42 wicket haul and India chased down the target of 114 with 6 wickets in hand. Ravindra Jadeja was awarded Man of the Match for his outstanding bowling performance</p>
